Account fees and details
Monthly service fee - $5 each fee period
A fee period can have 25 to 35 days. How we track and report your account activity, including what’s provided in your account statements, doesn’t always match a calendar month. Instead, we use a fee period to determine the monthly service fee and other monthly fees. We also use the fee period to count the number of posted transactions we allow before charging a fee.

How to avoid the fee - Avoid the $5 monthly service fee with one of the following each fee period:

1. $300 minimum daily balance
2. 1 automatic transfer each fee period of $25 or more from a linked Wells Fargo checking account
3. 1 automatic transfer each business day within the fee period of $1 or more from a linked Wells Fargo checking account
4. 1 or more Save As You Go1 transfers from a linked Wells Fargo checking account
5. Primary account owner is 24 years old or under

Non-U.S. citizens without a U.S. issued taxpayer identification number must provide a government issued ID that provides evidence of nationality or residence.
Each primary account owner, co-owner, or joint owner will need these two forms of IDs.

One primary ID (original version):

- State-issued or U.S territory driver's license
- State-issued or U.S territory ID card
- Passport
- U.S. Armed Forces ID
- Permanent resident card
- Employment authorization card
- Border Crossing Card
- Tribal Identification issued by a federally recognized U.S. tribal government
- Consular card issued by Colombia, Guatemala, or Mexico
- El Salvador Documento Unico do Identidad (DUI) card

Plus a secondary ID (original version)

- Any ID that's acceptable as a primary ID
- ATM, credit, or debit card
- Employee ID
- Student ID
- Social Security card (signed)
- Birth certificate (original or certified copy)
- ID issued by a recognized business, education institution, or government agency (domestic or foreign)
Proof of address is required – If neither primary nor secondary ID contains your physical address, separate proof of address (for example a utility bill or school enrollment statement) will need to be provided.

Minors without a primary ID need to be accompanied by an adult co-owner who is a relative or guardian, and bring identification such as a Social Security card, birth certificate, or student ID.
